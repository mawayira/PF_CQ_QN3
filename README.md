# Sum of Integers Between Two Numbers Program

## Introduction

This C++ program calculates the sum of all integers between two user-supplied numbers, inclusive. The program prompts the user to enter two integers and then prints the sum of all the numbers between (and including) the two integers. If the first number is greater than the second, the program swaps them automatically to ensure the sum is calculated correctly.

## Features

- **Input Flexibility**: The program accepts two integers and automatically handles cases where the first number is larger than the second.
- **Range Sum Calculation**: It calculates and returns the sum of all integers from the smaller to the larger of the two numbers.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple prompts guide the user through the process of entering integers.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Save the program in a file named `sum_of_integers.cpp`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the `sum_of_integers.cpp` file.
4. Compile the program using a C++ compiler such as `gcc`:
   ```bash
   gcc sum_of_integers.cpp -o sum_of_integers
